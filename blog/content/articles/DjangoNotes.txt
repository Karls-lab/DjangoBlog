Django Notes
Views (views.py)
A view is a python function which takes an http request and uses the render() function to returns the data.
With this render function, I can pass arguments that pass dynamic data to my website.
		
Controller (urls.py)
The controller is the url patterns in the website. This controlls what links I can access in my website.
Url's are contained in a python list with each one stored in a path. Path takes 3 arguments, the 
pattern path, a function to server data, and an id name for the url.
		
Templates
Templates can be thought of the web urls that the user will potentially visit. 
They contain html and Django's coding bracket language. We can insert
custom python code and get custom dynamic data from the views file. The render() takes the 
template and displays the website.
Here, are some Django's code style:
Variable , must be a direct mapping from a variable, keep the names the same! 
Here's an example in views to map a variable: 'now': now
Tags  can be if/else blocks and for loops. 
Reference this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/templates/builtins/#ref-templates-builtins-tags
textVariable | Filters  this can filter text, create a max text size display field.
Reference this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/templates/builtins/#ref-templates-builtins-filters
With this new code, I can create a few templates and copy them to create many unique webpages with Django
		
The DataBase
I'm not directly interacting with the Database, but using models and Django functions to create tables
and then fill thoes tables with customized dynamic data.
Here's the model field reference: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#model-field-types
I'll need to understand how to create row objects: save, retrieve them, and delete them.
Override the ToString to give each row better representation. Perform simple queries and perform complex
queries that work across two related tables.

How do I reset the DataBase for Django?

1. Delete the database
2. python3 manage.py makemigrations
3. python3 manage.py migrate
		
Miscellaneous
I need to create a bunch of blog posts that will hold links in blog home. 
When I click on that link it will bring me to a persistant template of a specific blog.
