CSS selectors

Selectors can be stacked!
<code> h1, .special { <br> color: blue <br>} </code>
In HTML, you can add the <code> &ltbr&gt </code> tag anywhere to insert a line break. <br>
Also, don't forget that & + lt equals &lt, while & + gt equals &gt
There's different types of CSS selectors, the . is the class selector, the # is an ID, and h1 is a group selector. <br>
Dynamic Python Database for blog posts...
Today, I've been working on creating a dynamic database so I don't have to constantly write everything in html lmao.
Here are the steps to reset the database: delete the db.sqlite3 file. The populate python file will recreate the database
for you. After, run <code>python manage.py makemigrations</code> followed by <code>python manage.py makemigrations</code>
Okay, use this website:<a href="https://www.color-hex.com/">Hex Colors</a>for some good looking colors.
