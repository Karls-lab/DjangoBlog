Attribute selectors

This group of selectors gives you different ways to select elements based on the presence of a certain attribute on an element:

a[title] { }

Or even make a selection based on the presence of an attribute with a particular value:
a[href="https://example.com"] { }

Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

This group of selectors includes pseudo-classes, which style certain states of an element. 
The :hover pseudo-class for example selects an element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer:

a:hover { }

<p> <br> </br> </p>

It also includes pseudo-elements, which select a certain part of an element rather than the element itself. For example, 
::first-line always selects the first line of text inside an element (a <p> in the below case), 
acting as if a <span> was wrapped around the first formatted line and then selected.
